# AmpionAssignment

The Key-points of the work been done for the Ampion Assignments are as below:

01. The API is successfully hit with the proper connection built,even the status code has been validated and printed on the console.
02. The response body has been successfully captured to a string, and the same has been printed out on the console.
03. While the second method which deals about the JSON data parsing, I tried to convert the response body to a json array and then later convert it into json objects.
but the response which is received from the api is actually inside one array and we don't have separate objects inside based on dates,timelines or any other unique identification.
